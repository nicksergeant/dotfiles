# Tomorrow Theme
After having spent over five years using, tweaking and refining a personal editor theme I decided it was time to release "Tomorrow Theme" - a bright theme with pastel colours and sensible syntax highlighting. 

A theme should not get in your way but should aid your programming with easily identifiable colours that add meaning and enhance legibility. This was the main focus when developing Tomorrow. 

Check out [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) the next evolution of Tomorrow Theme!

## Take a look!

## Language Support
The theme has been designed to be language independent and should look great with any language. However, if you find this isn't the case, just send me some sample code and I'll try to fix it!

## The Future?
I may be releasing other variations of this theme and will certainly be adding support for other more text editors/IDEs.
