# PeepOpen.tmplugin

Extremely simple TextMate plugin that opens PeepCode on Cmd-T, **even** when there's no file opened in the current project.

## Installation

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/PlugIns
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/PlugIns
    curl http://cloud.github.com/downloads/pietern/PeepOpen-tmplugin/PeepOpen.tmplugin.tgz | tar xvf -

## Thanks

Thanks to Brian Collins for the [nice_find](http://github.com/briancollins/nice_find) plugin,
which was used as the starting point for this plugin.

## Disclaimer

I'm not planning on maintaining this. Rather, I hope that @topfunky will include it in the
standard PeepOpen package.
