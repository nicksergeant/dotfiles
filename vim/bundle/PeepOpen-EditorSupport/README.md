PeepOpen Editor Support Files
=============================

[PeepOpen](http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen) is a stylish, powerful file navigation helper application for major text editors.

It requires plugins in each editor in order to activate it.

This repository contains the open source editor plugins. Fork and customize these, and we'll roll them back into the official commercial application periodically.
